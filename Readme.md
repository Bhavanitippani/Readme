PROJECT TITLE
FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM – SQL + DATA ANALYTICS + POWER BI

 INTRODUCTION
  This project simulates a real-world food delivery platform similar to Swiggy / Zomato, designed using:
•	MySQL → Backend Database
•	SQL Queries + Stored Procedures → Business Logic
•	Power BI Dashboards → Data Analytics
This system covers customers, restaurants, menu items, orders, and order items, delivering complete   business insights.

POWER BI DASHBOARDS
•	Dashboard 1 – Executive Overview
•	 Dashboard 2 – Restaurant Performance
•	 Dashboard 3 – Customer Behaviour
 Includes slicers, drill-through, KPIs, charts, tooltips.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
•	MySQL Workbench
•	SQL
•	Power BI
•	DAX
•	Data Cleaning (Power Query)


 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
This project follows a clean 3-Layer Architecture:
 Database Layer – MySQL
•	Stores customers, restaurants, menu items, orders
•	Maintains referential integrity
•	Ensures ACID properties
•	Data stored in normalized form
 Logic Layer – SQL
•	SQL Queries for analytics
•	Stored Procedure Place Order ()
•	Automates order creation
•	Updates stock, calculates bill
•	Fully transactional
 Visualization Layer – Power BI
•	3 Interactive Dashboards
•	KPI Cards, Line Charts, Bar Graphs, Donut Charts
